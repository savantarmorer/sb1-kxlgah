## New Implementation Details

### Tournament System Architecture

typescript
// Core Tournament Types
interface Tournament {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  start_date: string;
  end_date: string;
  entry_fee: number;
  max_participants: number;
  status: TournamentStatus;
  rules: TournamentRules;
  rewards: TournamentRewards;
}

// Tournament State Management
interface TournamentState {
  activeTournament: Tournament | null;
  userTournaments: Tournament[];
  currentMatch: TournamentMatch | null;
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}
```

### Component Structure
```
Tournament/
├── TournamentList.tsx    # List of available tournaments
├── TournamentCard.tsx    # Individual tournament display
├── TournamentBracket.tsx # Tournament progression visualization
└── MatchView.tsx         # (In Progress) Active match interface
```

### Service Layer
The `TournamentService` class handles all tournament-related operations:
- Tournament creation
- Participant registration
- Match management
- Score submission

### Current Development Focus
- Implementing MatchView component
- Integrating real-time match updates
- Setting up tournament progression logic

### Known Issues
1. Tournament bracket visualization needs optimization for mobile devices
2. Real-time updates need error recovery mechanism
3. Tournament registration needs rate limiting
4. Need to implement question caching for better performance
5. Timer synchronization between players needs improvement

- Added tournament context and basic state management
- Implemented tournament list and bracket visualization
- Created tournament match hook for game logic
- Set up basic tournament service layer
- Implemented MatchView component with:
  - Real-time question loading
  - Answer handling
  - Score tracking
  - Timer integration
  - Sound effects
  - Visual feedback
  - Responsive design

### Next Steps
1. Implement scoring system
2. Add tournament reward distribution
3. Implement round progression logic
4. Add tournament completion handling

## Development Context
